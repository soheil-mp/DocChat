# Technical Plan and README for Knowledge Base Chat with RAG

## Technical Plan

### Project Outline and Goals
The objective of this project is to develop a single-page web application where users can:
- Upload documents to a knowledge base.
- Interact with the knowledge base in a conversational format, supported by RAG to deliver relevant responses.
- Customize model parameters to fine-tune the chat experience.

The tech stack for this project includes:
- **Backend:** LangGraph, for orchestrating the language model with retrieval mechanisms.
- **Frontend:** React for a dynamic single-page interface.
- **Database:** Suitable storage for document management and retrieval.

---

### 1. System Architecture
1. **Frontend**:
   - **Framework:** React (consider using Next.js for SSR if SEO is a consideration).
   - **Libraries:** React Query for data fetching, Axios for API requests, Tailwind CSS or Material UI for styling.
   - **Functionality:** Uploading documents, configuring model settings, and chatting with the knowledge base.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Framework:** FastAPI or Flask for RESTful API to interact with LangGraph and database.
   - **LangGraph Integration:** Utilize LangGraph to connect the language model (like OpenAI, GPT-3, etc.) with the document retriever.

3. **Database**:
   - **Document Storage**: Use **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for flexible document storage and easy retrieval.
   - **Vector Database**: For fast embedding and similarity search, use **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, or **FAISS**. This will store embeddings and allow efficient retrieval for the RAG model.
   - **Metadata Storage**: Store document metadata (title, upload date, author) alongside embeddings to help filter and manage documents.

4. **Model and RAG Pipeline**:
   - **Embeddings Generation**: Use LangGraph to manage embeddings, leveraging models like OpenAI's embeddings API or sentence-transformers.
   - **Retriever**: Connect LangGraph with the chosen vector database for fast similarity search.
   - **Generator**: Fine-tune or select an appropriate generation model, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 or Cohere's models.
   - **Combining RAG**: The retrieved documents will be passed to the generation model to provide a contextually relevant response.

### 2. Features & Customizations

#### a. Document Upload and Processing
   - **File Types**: Support multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
   - **Document Parsing**: Use libraries like PyMuPDF for PDF parsing and python-docx for DOCX files.
   - **Embedding Storage**: Embed documents upon upload and store them in the vector database.

#### b. Model Configuration Options
Allow users to customize the following parameters in the UI:
- **Model Selection**: Choose between different model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.)
- **Temperature**: Adjust for creative vs. deterministic responses.
- **Max Tokens**: Control the length of the response.
- **Top-p**: Control response diversity through nucleus sampling.
- **Frequency Penalty**: Prevent repetitive responses.
- **Presence Penalty**: Adjust response uniqueness.
- **Document Filter**: Allow users to filter the retrieved documents based on metadata.
- **Retrieval Settings**: Number of documents to retrieve for each query, search depth.
- **Embedding Model Choice**: Users can choose from a list of embedding models (e.g., OpenAI, sentence-transformers).

### 3. UI/UX Design Ideas

#### Main Components:
- **Navigation Panel**: Simple navbar for access to the chat, upload, and configuration sections.
- **Chat Interface**: Central chat area with message bubbles for user and knowledge base interactions.
  - **Real-time Loading Indicator**: Show a loading spinner when the model is generating a response.
  - **Response History**: Enable the user to scroll through previous messages.
- **Upload Section**: Drag-and-drop area with file selection options.
  - **File List**: Display uploaded files, with options for deleting or reprocessing files.
  - **Status Indicators**: Show processing status (e.g., "processing," "embedding completed").
- **Configuration Panel**: Sidebar with customizable settings for the model.
  - **Toggle Switches**: Use for binary settings like frequency and presence penalties.
  - **Dropdowns or Sliders**: For numeric values like temperature and max tokens.

### 4. Deployment Plan
Deploy the project in a cloud environment for scalability and reliability:
   - **Frontend**: Deploy via Vercel or Netlify.
   - **Backend and Database**: Host on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - **Vector Database**: If using Pinecone or Weaviate, integrate via API. Otherwise, host FAISS with the backend.

## README.md Structure

### Project Name
**Knowledge Base Chat with RAG**

### Project Description
A single-page application that lets users upload documents to a knowledge base and interact with the uploaded content via a conversational AI. The project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure responses are relevant to the documents.

### Features
- **Document Upload**: Add various document types to the knowledge base.
- **Chat with Knowledge Base**: Converse with AI trained to retrieve and understand uploaded documents.
- **Model Configuration**: Fine-tune model parameters for customized responses.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL (for document storage)
- Access to a vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS)

#### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   cd project-name

2. **Frontend Setup**
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start

3. **Backend Setup**
   - **Create virtual environment**:
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
   - **Install dependencies**:
     pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Environment Variables**
   Set up the following variables in a `.env` file:
   - Database credentials for MongoDB/PostgreSQL
   - API keys for model providers (OpenAI, Cohere)
   - Pinecone or Weaviate API credentials

5. **Run Backend**
   python main.py

#### Usage

1. **Upload Documents**
   - Navigate to the "Upload" section, drag-and-drop files, and wait for processing.

2. **Interact with the Knowledge Base**
   - Go to the "Chat" section, ask questions, and get responses based on uploaded documents.

3. **Adjust Model Settings**
   - In the "Settings" tab, configure parameters to fine-tune the AI responses.

### Configuration Options
- **Model Selection**: [OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face]
- **Temperature**: [0.1 - 1.0]
- **Max Tokens**: [0 - 2048]
- **Top-p**: [0.0 - 1.0]
- **Frequency Penalty**: [0.0 - 2.0]
- **Presence Penalty**: [0.0 - 2.0]

### Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Document Filtering**: Enable search within specific documents.
- **Response Summarization**: Summarize lengthy responses.
- **Admin Dashboard**: For managing documents and monitoring usage.
